// Proves the guest DLL and the host executor expand a narrow colour channel to
// eight bits by the identical rule.
//
// This is one comparison with two implementations on opposite sides of a DMA
// arena, and nothing else forces them to agree. A DirectDraw colour key is a
// value in the surface's own format -- 5 bits of red in RGB565 -- while the
// GPU compares 8-bit texels the host produced on upload. If the guest widens
// the key by one rule and the host widens the texels by another, the key
// misses on exactly the values where the rules differ, and the sprite that
// should have been keyed blits as a solid rectangle. Bit replication and
// truncated scaling differ at 24/31 (198 against 197), which is an ordinary
// colour, so this is not a corner case.
//
// The guest side is compiled and run for real rather than reimplemented here:
// a copy of the rule in the test would only prove the copy agrees with itself.
// Needs any host C compiler; skipped when there is none.
